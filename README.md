# Furry-Game

Workshop #2 - Creating a sample JS game where Furry has to collect coins on a 10x10 map.

## Introduction

The website is a training project of an invented furniture store created during the second workshop on a coding bootcamp in the Coders Lab programming school. Naturally, there are still possibilites for further development of this webpage.

## Future Updates

* I'm planning to fix the GAME OVER screen. (10-16.12.2018)
* Add restart button to the whole project (17-23.12.2018)
